    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Hello! I'm Zora -- a small VTuber on YouTube and Twitch. I'm working on an operating system inspired by a dream.</p>
    <hr>
    <h1>The Dream</h1>
    <p>The dream that inspired me was one unlike any dream I'd had before. I was in an old rusted building with a sparking computer showing millions of errors. Yet it refused to crash, even the display failed and yet, you could tell it was still online.

        This made me wonder how this was possible. So, then set out to make this operating system -- one that refuses to crash.</p>
